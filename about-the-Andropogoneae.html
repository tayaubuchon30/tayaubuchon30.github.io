    <h1>About the Andropogoneae</h1>
    
    <h2>Where are Andropogoneae?</h2>
    <p>Everywhere! The vast cornfields of midwestern North America replaced the tallgrass prairie that occupied the same land since the glaciers retreated. The massive grasslands of eastern and western Africa provide food for herbivores both large (wildebeest, zebras) and small (insects of all sorts) and were the home of the earliest mammals now called <i>Homo sapiens</i>. The tropical savannas of Australia and southeast Asia and the cerrado of South America all are ecosystems that rival the rainforests of those countries. What all these grasslands – including the corn (maize) – have in common is that the grasses are all members of a single evolutionary radiation, or clade, the grass tribe Andropogoneae.</p>

    <h2>How old is Andropogoneae?</h2>
    <p>Andropogoneae includes ca. 1200 named species, representing about one tenth of all grass species. The tribe is thought to have originated in the Eastern Hemisphere, possibly in southern or eastern Asia, in the Miocene, about 13 million years ago (9.89-17.97). The tribe Arundinelleae is well supported as a sister group and some authors (e.g. Kellogg, 2015) include this as a subtribe within Andropogoneae, although most retain the more traditional structure of separate tribes. Here we consider Andropogoneae in its strict sense, as excluding Arundinelleae.</p>

    <h2>Spikelet morphology</h2>
    <p>In most species, the sessile spikelet is bisexual and bears the seed.  The pedicellate spikelet, in contrast, varies extensively among members of the tribe, with the many variants providing useful taxonomic traits.  The pedicellate spikelet may be larger or smaller than the sessile spikelet, or may be absent entirely.  In the latter case, the pedicel may still be present or may itself be reduced. In a few genera (e.g. Cleistachne), the pedicellate spikelet and pedicel are entirely absent, and in Dimeria, the sessile spikelet is absent.  However, these are exceptions.  The pedicellate spikelet may be bisexual and morphologically similar to the sessile spikelet, but in most taxa is staminate or sterile, with the sex expression often being useful taxonomically.</p>   

    <p>Spikelets in Andropogoneae often bear awns from one or more floral bracts (glumes, lemmas, paleas). The position, structure, and length of awns are often useful for species identification even though the precise function of awns is unclear and may vary from one species to the next.  The most common position is on the upper lemma of the sessile spikelet.  Awns in this position may be straight but more often are twisted and geniculate, with the knee-like bend caused by a reversal in the direction of the twist.  Absence of lemma awns is apparently derived, with losses documented in various clades that are otherwise awned.  Major clades that are entirely awnless are recognized as subtribes Rottboelliinae, Ratzeburgiinae, Rhytachninae, and Tripsacinae but current phylogenies are uncertain as to whether these subtribes form a larger awnless clade or are independently derived.</p>
